To generate a 42 rendu:
----------------------
cargo clean manually inside integration_tester directory inside the rust_kernel directory

go the the root of the KFS project

make fclean

cp -RvL rendu target_directory_outside_the_project
(-L, --dereference Follow symbolic links when copying from them. With this option, cp cannot create a symbolic link.
For example, a symlink (to regular file) in the source tree will be copied to a regular file in the destination tree.)

cd target_directory_outside_the_project

it's done !

Dont forget to git init . and git remote add vogsphere_stuff to put the entire project in 42 network !
